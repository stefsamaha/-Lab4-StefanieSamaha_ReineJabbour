This report provides a comprehensive overview of the School Management System, a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage student, instructor, and course data within an educational institution. It is done using both PyQt5 and Tkinter technologies. 

PyQt Part: 
The Python script creates a desktop application for managing students, instructors, and courses in a school. It uses the PyQt5 library for building the graphical user interface (GUI).

- Features:
1. Add, edit, and delete students, instructors, and courses.
2. Register students for courses.
3. Assign instructors to courses.
4. Search for students, instructors, and courses based on name or email.
5. Save and load data from JSON files.
6. Export data to a CSV file.
7. Backup data to a separate JSON file.
 
- Using the Application:
Download and install the required libraries: PyQt5, sqlite3, json, and csv.
Run the script: the application window will open with various forms and buttons.
Use the provided forms to enter details for students, instructors, and courses.
Use the buttons to perform actions like adding, registering, assigning, searching, saving, loading, exporting, and editing records.
